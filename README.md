## Game's instructions
- The game starts by entering the number of players (2-99) and then pressing enter. Then enter the number of cards (default 1-26000). When you press start, the game and the timer starts. 
- In the game, players take turns turning over cards by pressing them. After this, the player presses end turn button and the cards face is hidden and the turn goes to the next player, unless the player's guessed cards were the same, in which case the player would continue their turn and the correctly guessed cards would remain visible. 
- The game is played for so long until the last pairs are turned over on the table. After this, the winner or tie information will be published.
- The game can be reset in any situation by pressing the reset key, in which case the initial values (number of players and cards) are entered again.
- In the game, you can see the score situation from the scoboard list all the time. You can also see the time all the time. The program can be turned off with the quit key.
